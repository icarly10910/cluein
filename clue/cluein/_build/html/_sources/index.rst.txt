Welcome to Cluein's documentation!
==================================

Project Summary: I’ve been in the process of creating a website that takes articles of clothing from a user’s closet and mixes and matches into cohesive, fashionable outfits. This will be used so customers can set up and visualize outfits they want to wear for the week. I’ve set up the website to for one customer closet. My website currently lets users interact with adding, updating, and removing articles of clothing from their cluein closet. Although I've implemented the basic functionality and backend behind my web app, I would like to continue to work on the website so that useres can mix and match their clothes.

Requirements: I had five basic requirements I wanted to accomplish out of the project:
1. Users must be able to add articles of clothing from their closet,
2. Users must be able to remove articles of clothing from their closet.
3. Users must be able to search for articles of clothing that they want for their closet from store inventory.
4. Users must be able to add articles of clothing that they want for their closet from store inventory.
5. Users must be able to visualize their outfits

Although I only ended up being able to complete #1, #2, #5, I plan on continuing to complete my other requirements after the project is over.

For my project, I used Django as my framework and python as my programming language.
