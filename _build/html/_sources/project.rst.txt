Project Summary
===============

Goals Achieved
--------------
Goal 1 - Users must be able to add articles of clothing from their closet.
I was able to implement adding articles of clothing using forms with Django.
Goal 2 - Users must be able to remove articles of clothing from their closet.
I was able to implement delete articles of clothing a user doesn't want anymore from their closet using forms with Django.

Lessons Learned
---------------
I realized that I set my expectations way too high for this project, because I was excited to implement my idea. I realize in the future I need to be thinking more realistically about my outcomes at the end of a deadline.
